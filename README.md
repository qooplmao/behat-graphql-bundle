# Behat GraphQL Extension

[Behat](http://behat.org) extension to write GraphQL API tests easily, separated from [ynloultratech/graphql-bundle](https://github.com/ynloultratech/graphql-bundle-docs) updated for Symfony 5.

I'm currently using the [Overblog GraphQLBundle](https://github.com/overblog/GraphQLBundle) and wanted to find something lightweight to be able to perform testing.
