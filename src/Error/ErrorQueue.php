/**
 * Throw errors in a queue in order to display later
 * alongside the data in the response. Works similar to Symfony FlashBag message container.
 *
 * For example, a client make a mutation and the operation
 * is made partially, the server must need return the modified data to the client
 * but is needed too inform of any error happened to display why the operation has been made partially.
 *
 * Itâ€™s like having a talk with a real human:
 * "Hey Johny, here are all you asked me to save. I did everything except that task; I went to save it up, but I don't permission to save it".
